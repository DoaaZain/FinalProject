Therefore, the sign sizes are mainly determined by the length of the message to \\nbe written. \\nGuiding colors are also different, and the colors have been determined according to the \\ntype of message, for example: \\n1. Signs on roads outside the cities, the background shall be blue and the writing in \\nwhite. Inside cities, the background is green and the writing is white. \\n2.

To indicate significant destinations such as hospitals, the background color shall be \\nwhite and the writing in black. \\n5.
